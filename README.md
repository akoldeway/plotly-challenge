# Plotly Challenge - Belly Button Biodiversity


## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build and interactive dashboard to explor the Belly Button Biodiversity Data Set.

Selecting a sample will engage each chart and display the following:
*  top 10 bacterias for each sample (pie chart)
  * hovering over each slice of the pie chart will display the full bacteria name
* belly button washing frequency (gauge chart)
* all bacterias for each sample (bubble chart)
  * hovering over each bubble will dispaly the full bacteria name
